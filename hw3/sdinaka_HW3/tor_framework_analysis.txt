README(q5):

What the program does:

	- List the top 5 country codes hosting Tor relays 
	- List the top 5 relays with maximum bandwidth-contributing 
	- Venn diagram of 
		-categories as guard, exit or middle relay.
		-the number of relays for each category
		- the cumulative bandwidth for each category.

How it does:
parse file tor.csv, append headers to header list

3 functions are defined.
	- first_five( top 5 country codes hosting Tor relays )
		-count number of times country code appears
	- first_five_bw(top 5 relays with maximum bandwidth-contributing )
		-sort and reverse bandwidth measure
	- ven(Venn diagram of categories)
			exit_r: values for exit relay across all rows
			exit_no: count of number of exit relays
			exit_no_bw: cumulative consensus bw
		sIMILARLY FOR entry, mid and entry cum exit relays
