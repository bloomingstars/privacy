What the program does:

- display a list of third party domains from which html objects are loaded
- show connectivity graph representing domains from which html objects are loaded
 only domains are displayed.
the sub-domains are covered under domains


How it does:

- arguments are passed in command line, 
		-har file 	
		-current domain name
-theses args are passed to main function
- first node, the root node is current domain
-har file(as json) is parsed, every entry in log is parsed
-from each entry url is retrived through request
- the domain is extracted from url
-the following comparisons are made
		- if domain is not current domain(3rd party)
		- if domain already present in list of 3rd party domains(subdomains with same domain)
		- if the domain isn't empty
- if all are satisfied, the domain is added to list of 3rd part domains	


- each thord party domain has an edge connecting that domain and the current domain


How to execute:
[syntax] python file_name.py 'path_of_har_file' 'domain of site to ehich the har file belongs to'
